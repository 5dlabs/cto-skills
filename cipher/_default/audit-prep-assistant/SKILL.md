# Audit Prep Assistant

## Purpose

Help prepare for a security review using Trail of Bits' checklist. A well-prepared codebase makes the review process smoother and more effective.

**Use this**: 1-2 weeks before your security audit

## The Preparation Process

### Step 1: Set Review Goals

Define what you want from the review:

**Key Questions**:

- What's the overall security level you're aiming for?
- What areas concern you most?
  - Previous audit issues?
  - Complex components?
  - Fragile parts?
- What's the worst-case scenario for your project?

Document your goals to share with the assessment team.

### Step 2: Resolve Easy Issues

Run static analysis and help fix low-hanging fruit:

**Run Static Analysis**:

For Solidity:

```bash
slither . --exclude-dependencies
```

For Rust:

```bash
dylint --all
```

For Go:

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

Then:

- Triage all findings
- Help fix easy issues
- Document accepted risks

**Increase Test Coverage**:

- Analyze current coverage
- Identify untested code
- Suggest new tests
- Run full test suite

**Remove Dead Code**:

- Find unused functions/variables
- Identify unused libraries
- Locate stale features
- Suggest cleanup

**Goal**: Clean static analysis report, high test coverage, minimal dead code

### Step 3: Ensure Code Accessibility

Make your code clear and accessible:

**Provide Detailed File List**:

- List all files in scope
- Mark out-of-scope files
- Explain folder structure
- Document dependencies

**Create Build Instructions**:

- Write step-by-step setup guide
- Test on fresh environment
- Document dependencies and versions
- Verify build succeeds

**Freeze Stable Version**:

- Identify commit hash for review
- Create dedicated branch
- Tag release version
- Lock dependencies

**Identify Boilerplate**:

- Mark copied/forked code
- Highlight your modifications
- Document third-party code
- Focus review on your code

### Step 4: Generate Documentation

Create comprehensive documentation:

**Flowcharts and Sequence Diagrams**:

- Map primary workflows
- Show component relationships
- Visualize data flow
- Identify critical paths

**User Stories**:

- Define user roles
- Document use cases
- Explain interactions
- Clarify expectations

**On-chain/Off-chain Assumptions**:

- Data validation procedures
- Oracle information
- Bridge assumptions
- Trust boundaries

**Actors and Privileges**:

- List all actors
- Document roles
- Define privileges
- Map access controls

**Function Documentation**:

- System and function invariants
- Parameter ranges (min/max values)
- Arithmetic formulas and precision loss
- Complex logic explanations
- NatSpec for Solidity

**Glossary**:

- Define domain terms
- Explain acronyms
- Consistent terminology
- Business logic concepts

## Rationalizations (Do Not Skip)

| Rationalization | Why It's Wrong | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "README covers setup, no need for detailed build instructions" | READMEs assume context auditors don't have | Test build on fresh environment, document every dependency version |
| "Static analysis already ran, no need to run again" | Codebase changed since last run | Execute static analysis tools, generate fresh report |
| "Test coverage looks decent" | "Looks decent" isn't measured coverage | Run coverage tools, identify specific untested code paths |
| "Not much dead code to worry about" | Dead code hides during manual review | Use automated detection tools to find unused functions/variables |
| "Architecture is straightforward, no diagrams needed" | Text descriptions miss visual patterns | Generate actual flowcharts and sequence diagrams |
| "Can freeze version right before audit" | Last-minute freezing creates rushed handoff | Identify and document commit hash now, create dedicated branch |
| "Terms are self-explanatory" | Domain knowledge isn't universal | Create comprehensive glossary with all domain-specific terms |
| "I'll do this step later" | Steps build on each other - skipping creates gaps | Complete all 4 steps sequentially, track progress with checklist |
